        We check for the mail every 10 seconds
        We check for the mail every 20 seconds. 
    Obviously this is relatively overlapping, it is just to show that

A thread is just a block of code that is expected to execute while other blocks of code execute. Thatâ€™s it. When you want to execute more than one block of code at a time you have to alert Java.
